# Super Store Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding sales of 3 branches of a superstore.
The total records are 1000.
The dataset can be found in the https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales/notebooks
The columns are quite self explanatory.
## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I tried to understand the buying pattern related to Gender,
Payment mode, Product lines, City and Branches of the Superstore.
The women customers are more and they prefer payment by cash rather then credit.
The availibility of credit may be attributed to some rural or poor background.
Also the totals count decrease as the amount increases. High sales are during
initial days of the month which can be attributed to the salary days where 
the buying can be more though the upswing after 25th is an interesting phenomenon.
Higher ratings are Food and beverages. Do these supermarket sell some top quality foods?
Home and lifestyle have lower ratings.




Outside of the main variables of interest, I also tried to eshtablish
the peak time of sales and what is sold the most in the evening.
One branch have more cash sales then credit sales. Food and Beverages
has the highest share of the total sales. January has the highest sales.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation,  I have analysed the gender preferences of payment mode,
sales distribution for the total, gender preferences of product line, branch wise
payment mode preferences, ratings and product line relationship and buying pattern according
to the days of the month.
